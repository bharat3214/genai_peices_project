# Fun Gym Facts 💪

This simple website displays a random fun fact about the gym every time you click the "New Fact" button. 

## How it Works ⚙️

- **HTML:** The structure of the page is created with HTML, including a heading, a paragraph for the fact, and a button.
- **CSS:** Basic styling is applied using CSS to center the content and give it a clean look.
- **JavaScript:** The JavaScript code does the following:
    - Stores an array of fun facts about the gym.
    - Generates a random number to select a fact from the array.
    - Displays the selected fact in the paragraph element.
    - Updates the displayed fact each time the button is clicked.
